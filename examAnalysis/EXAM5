By default, all Amazon DynamoDB tables are encrypted using "AWS owned keys", which do not write to AWS CloudTrail logs
All DynamoDB tables are encrypted. There is no option to enable or disable encryption for new or existing tables.


Use "database cloning" to create multiple clones of the production database and use each clone as a "test database"
 > You cannot clone databases across AWS regions.
 > Currently, you are limited to 15 clones based on a copy
 Note: binlog replication and mysqldump utility requires several manual steps
 

Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability


ALB removes an instance from its pool of healthy instances whenever it is detected as unhealthy but the ASG fails to kick-in and provision the replacement instance.
  > The ASG is using Amazon EC2 based health check and the ALB is using ALB based health check
  
  
  
S3: A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3 always returns the latest version of the object
Amazon S3 delivers strong read-after-write consistency(先寫後讀一致性) automatically, without changes to performance or availability,



AWS WAF can be deployed on 
 O Amazon CloudFront
 O ALB
 O API Gateway
 X EC2 instance
 

Data transfer pricing over AWS Direct Connect is lower than data transfer pricing over the internet



same load balancer, linked to different target groups with different URLs, that are similar to these - checkout.mycorp.com, www.mycorp.com, mycorp.com/profile, and mycorp.com/search.
 O ALB:Path-based Routing

start from Q41

ALB + EC2 + CloudFront , got many SQL injection and cross-site scripting attack
 O Use AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) with Amazon CloudFront distribution
 X Use AWS Security Hub with Amazon CloudFront distribution :You cannot use Security Hub to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
 
 
ALB + EC2 + AWS WAF:
block access to application from specific countries; allow  remote development team (from one of the blocked countries) to have access to the application. 
 O Block: AWS WAF geo match
 O Allow: AWS WAF IP set
 X ALB: cannot block or allow traffic based on geographic match conditions or IP based conditions. 
 X network access control list (network ACL) does not have the capability to block traffic based on geographic match conditions.
 
 
By default, cross-zone load balancing  
 > ALB enabled
 > NLB disabled
 
 
Amazon EC2 instance public IP
 http://"169.254".169.254/latest/"meta-data"/public-ipv4
 
 
 
ALB + EC2 - CRM application;
users reporting frequent sign-in requests from the application; 
root cause: unhealthy servers causing session data to be lost.
 O Elasticache for distributed in-memory cache based session management
 X sticky sessions enable each user to interact with one server and one server only; unhealthy instance session is gone
 

Amazon RDS database what happens when the primary instance of the Multi-AZ configuration goes down.
 O CNAME record will be updated to point to the standby database
 
 
Data protection mechanisms on AWS S3
 O S3 can encrypt data in transit using HTTPS (TLS)
 O S3 can protect data at rest using Client-Side Encryption
 O S3 can protect data at rest using Server-Side Encryption
 X S3 can encrypt object "metadata" by using Server-Side Encryption: Metadata, which can be included with the object, is not encrypted while being stored on Amazon S3
 
 
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) : message processing failures for some customer orders.
 O Use a dead-letter queue to handle message processing failures
 X Use short/long polling to handle message processing failures
 X temporary queues: The most common use case for temporary queues is the request-response messaging pattern (EX: processing a login request).
 


In case of an Instance Health Check failure, an "EC2 Reboot CloudWatch Alarm Action" can be used to reboot the instance.


Amazon EBS volumes are Availability Zone (AZ) locked:
 You can attach an Amazon EBS volume to an Amazon EC2 instance "in the same AZ".
 
 
S3 event notification destination
 O Standard SQS
 X FIFO SQS
 
 
Solve Kinesis Data Streams getting a "ProvisionedThroughputExceededException" exception.
 O Use batch messages
 X Increase the number of shards :Increasing shards could be a short term fix but will substantially increase the cost
 
 
ASB EC2
It is not possible to "modify a launch configuration once it is created. 



Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS); Multiple consumer applications; performance lag for the "data delivery speed" between producers and consumers.
 O Use Enhanced Fanout feature of Amazon KDS: You should use enhanced fan-out if you have multiple consumers retrieving data from a stream in parallel
 X KDS + Kinesis Data Firehose: KDF can only write to Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch or Splunk.
 
 
Spread placement group of Amazon EC2 instances:
 每個AZ最多7個instances

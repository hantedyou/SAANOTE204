1	Auto Scaling group (ASG) is not terminating an unhealthy Amazon EC2 instance.
What might happen?
Sol: 
	The health check grace period(寬限期) for the instance has not expired : ASG啟動EC2後的一段等待時間
	The instance maybe in Impaired status
	The instance has failed the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) health check status
(1)	spot instance type can be terminated by the Auto Scaling group (ASG)
(2)	A user might have updated the configuration of the ASG and increased the minimum number of instances : ASG will launch new

2	Aurora Multi-AZ reads are causing high input/output (I/O) and adding latency to the write requests. How to solve?
Sol: Set up a read replica and modify the application to use the appropriate endpoint
(1)	Provision another Amazon Aurora database and link it to the primary database as a read replica: No such thing
(2)	Configure the application to read from the Multi-AZ standby instance: No such thing
(3)	Activate read-through caching on the Amazon Aurora database: Aurora沒有內建的cache，可以整合ElastiCache ，但要修改程式

3	Use Case:
	A company is located in an area prone to natural disasters.
	not ready to fully migrate to the AWS Cloud
	wants a failover environment on AWS
	Web server.
	Data available on AWS and on-premises must be uniform.
	Solution should have the LEAST amount of downtime
Sol: 
	Route 53 failover record
	Application servers: ASG (EC2) + ALB
	Storage Gateway with stored volumes to back up data to Amazon S3
Explain:
	Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3


4	Monitor CPU utilization of EC2 instances and send notification by Email when breach a certain threshold. 
Building a solution with the LEAST amount of development effort.
Sol: Amazon CloudWatch + SNS
(1)	AWS Step Functions / Lambda: cannot monitor CPU utilization of EC2 instances or send notification emails

5	Steps do migrate from an AWS Organization A to an AWS Organization B?
Sol: 
	Remove the member account from the old organization
	Send an invite to the member account from the new Organization
	Accept the invite to the new organization from the member account
		
6	Use case:
	on-premises data center using SQL Server has a heavy read load.
	Everyday production database needs to generate full copy and populate to DEV DB which cause high latency
	migrating database engines if required
Sol:
	Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas (Aurora only compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL)
	Dev database: restoring from the automated backups of Amazon Aurora. 
		Explain: Aurora DB backup won’t impact performance. 
(1)	Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas and restore the dev database via mysqldump: using mysqldump to restore Dev DB would result in a significant load on the primary DB
(2)	RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and use the standby instance as the dev database: standby is just for handling failover in a Multi-AZ deployment cannot access the standby instance and use it as a dev database
(3)	RDS for SQL server with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas. Use the read replica as the dev database: read replica does not allow any database write operations.

7	Migrating ETL workloads to AWS Cloud from Hadoop cluster deployed in the on-premises data center. The AWS Cloud solution needs to be highly available with about 50 EC2 instances per AZ. 
Which EC2 placement groups is recommended.
Sol: Partition placement group
